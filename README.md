# From Notebooks to Research Packages, Part II

### Homework 3 from STAT 259 - Collaborative and Reproducible Data Science
#### Fall 2025

This assignment starts from the end of Homework 2, where we worked with the reasearch and the code from the LIGO Gravitational Wave Detection Tutorial.

This homework puts in practice the making of installable packages, testing through pytest, modularizing Python code, buillding sites with MyST, deploying through GitHub Pages/Actions and finally, the use of Makefiles.
